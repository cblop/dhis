# About the project

Collaboration between:

- University of Bath
- Sysemia Ltd, Bristol
- Bishop's Palace, Wells

TSB-funded feasibility study

---

# What is it?

- Person walks around the exhibition space with a tablet device
- Bluetooth LE beacons (iBeacons) are used to get their location
- They are given options and recommendations based on where they go and what they do
- BUT: in a narrative-y way

# Bluetooth LE beacons

<!-- pic would be nice -->

- Work like radio beacons (but using Bluetooth LE)
- Just send out a signal
- Distance from beacon is based on signal strength

---

# Design

- Resembles a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book
- Story is told in the second person
- Three types of action: _visit_, _examine_ and _ask_.
- Actions are stored as a list of events

---

# Recommendations

- Introduced in the context of the narrative
- Example:
  > _"You remember someone in the local pub telling you about this painting of Bishop Jocelyn. She suggested also looking at the chair he used, which is in the Bishop's house."_

# How are facts stored?

- RDF semantics (subject-predicate-object triples)
- Stored in JSON-LD format
- schema.org ontology for simplicity

---

# Event Calculus solver

<!-- get ref for this -->

- The Event Calculus describes how events happen over time using mathematical logic
- This allows us to reason about what may or may not be true at a certain point in time

---

# The Event Calculus

- _Fluents_ are properties that are true or false.
- Events _occur_, which _initiate_ or _terminate_ fluents at instants in time
- A fluent _holds_ (is true) at a point in time if it has been initiated, but not terminated.

---

# Implementation details

- Runs on Nexus 7 tablet
- HTML based, Cordova app
- Coded in Clojurescript
- Clojurescript's core.logic for Event Calculus
